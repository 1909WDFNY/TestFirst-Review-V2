# TestFirst-Review-V2

Hi all - please be careful when you add files so that you don't accidentally alter or delete someone else's. Also please put your name in the file name i.e. "pig-latin_YourNameHere.js" - it'll make it harder to overwrite files on accident, and people will be able to find you and ask you questions or give you kudos for your code.

1. If you're worried about directly pushing into the repo, just select **Create new file** (one of the buttons to the left of the green clone/download button), fill in the file path, and paste in your work. 

2. If the folder (e.g. "00-pig-latin") doesn't exist yet, you can type the file path directly while creating your file name (e.g. "00-pig-latin/pig-latin_YourNameHere.js") and it'll create the folder.)

3. Be sure to end your file name in ".js", otherwise the text won't get special color formatting and it'll be harder to read.

Thanks, everyone!
